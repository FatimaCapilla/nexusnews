# Description

Nexus News is a web application designed for browsing and creating technology news. It is developed using React in the frontend, with JavaScript, and TypeScript in the backend.

Upon launching the application, a login form is presented allowing access as either an administrator or user. Additionally, a registration form is provided to create a user account, which generates an access token necessary for viewing and creating news.

Registered users can access the platform to view and create news. As an administrator, you have additional access to edit and delete news, in addition to the viewing and creation functions available to regular users.
